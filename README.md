## React Concepts Used in ProGear Sports

**Component-Based Architecture:** The entire project is structured with reusable, modular components such as Navbar,ProductCard, and Footer. This modular approach makes it easy to manage, extend, and maintain the codebase as the project grows.<br>

**Context API for Global State Management:** The Context API is utilized to manage global states like user authentication, theme preferences, and product data, ensuring smooth data flow across components.<br>

**React Router for Private Routing:** React Router is implemented to create private routes, restricting access to specific pages for authenticated users only.<br>

**useEffect for Side Effects:** useEffect is used for fetching user and product data from MongoDB, synchronizing authentication states, and applying theme settings.<br>

**Conditional Rendering:** Conditional rendering is used to control UI based on the application state, like displaying " theme toggling" when the toggling state is true then some design are extend or changed.<br>

**Integration of Third-Party Libraries:** Tools like Lottie for animations and React Tooltip for enhanced user interaction demonstrate seamless third-party library integration.<br>


## Data Management Strategy in ProGear Sports

**Firebase Authentication** Manages secure login/logout and user sessions.<br>
**MongoDB**  Handles user and product data with robust storage and CRUD operations.<br>
**Fetch API**  Retrieves and updates data from the backend, ensuring real-time interactions.<br>
